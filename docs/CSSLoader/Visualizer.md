# Visualizer

In the [Features](/CSSLoader/Features) page, it may be quite difficult to fully understand the layout of a `theme.json` file, especially for a beginner.

The CSSLoader team has made a web visualizer to help understand all features CSSLoader has to offer. Importing and Exporting .json files is supported. Feel free to import the examples from the [Features](/CSSLoader/Features) page, and see how they work. Feel free to also modify these examples, export the .json, and re-use them for your own themes.

!> Dependencies are currently not configurable trough the Visualizer
