## 🎨 Creating a Theme

Development for the CSS Loader is intended to be as simple as possible. That being said, we understand not everyone understands how to edit CSS files. If you have any suggestions for how we can make this guide easier to understand, please feel free to create an issue.

## 📋 Prerequisites

- Some experience in CSS and JSON
- Installed the CSS Loader
- (Optional) Installed a Chromium-based browser

## 📂 Template

There is [a template repository](https://github.com/suchmememanyskill/Steam-Deck-Theme-Template) you can use for creating your first theme. It contains all the files you need to get started and is pre-configured to work with the CSS Loader.

## 🪁 Getting Started
To more easily edit and test CSS, you can use the [CEF Debugger](CSSLoader/Cef_Debugger.md#🌐-cef-debugger) to make edits live on your deck

For an overview of everything CSS Loader can do, see the [Features](CSSLoader/Features.md#features) page

To visualize a theme configuration file (`theme.json`), see the [Theme.json Visualizer](CSSLoader/Visualizer.md#visualizer) page

For information on submitting a theme, see [Submit To DeckThemes.com](Submission.md#submit-to-deckthemescom)
